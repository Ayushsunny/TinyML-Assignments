# TinyML-Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the TinyML course

## Assignment 1

### Overview

In this assignment, we explore two neural network models to demonstrate the development and improvement of regression models using TensorFlow and Python. We first implement a basic single-layer neural network and then fine-tune it for better performance.

## Assignment 2

### Overview

In this assignment, we train a neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains images of various clothing items. We preprocess the data, define a model, train it, and evaluate its performance.
